# Logic Challenges: My Personal Journey

Hey there, welcome to my Logic Challenges repository! Here, you'll find a collection of exercises that were part of my personal journey to better understand objects, arrays, loops, and import/export concepts in programming.

## Why this Repository?
Each challenge here isn't just a problem to solve; it's a piece of the puzzle I put together during my exploration of these concepts. These challenges were solved live, during classes I attended, and now I'm sharing the results so we can learn together.

## What You'll Find?
My Solutions: Each challenge is an opportunity to apply what I've learned about objects, arrays, and loops. The solutions aren't just code; they're expressions of my understanding and evolution.

##  Join My Journey
This repository isn't just a place of exercises; it's a narrative of my learning journey. Feel free to explore, question, and even contribute with your own solutions or improvement suggestions.

## Invite You to Challenge Yourself
Whether you're starting out or looking to enhance your skills, these challenges are designed to inspire. Every broken algorithm is a victory in understanding programming logic.
